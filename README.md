# Deep-Learning-by-InceptionV1-GoogLeNet-Network
Implemented InceptionV1 (GoogLeNet) network, one of the convolutional neural networks, to classify images on the food_mnist dataset, attaining up to 75% accuracy in some classes of among 10 classes and increasing by 8% accuracy through optimized hyper parameters such as batch size, learning rate, steps per epoch and data augmentation method.
